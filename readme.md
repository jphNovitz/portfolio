#wp portfolio

Welome to my personnal portfolio, i made it using wordpress as a tool.

Wordpress is usefull to store articles and page.

I wanted my portfolio do be original and as personilized as possible, so i created a new theme folder with minimal files to respect the wp philosophy.

style.css => necessary for the theme to be recognized
index.php => for the home page
headers.php and footers.php
page.php and single.php for the display of specific pages and articles.

From a blank page a created my pages unsing the wp loop, query and predefined function.
